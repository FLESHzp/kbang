#summary Roadmap

= KBang Roadmap =

== KBang 0.2 ==
 * *Card sets.* We are still facing the licence issues, because we are using copyrighted material (card pictures) in an open-source code without permission of the copyright holder. The idea is to distribute KBang without those pictures and distribute them in other way. [CardSet_Architecture] will allow this.
 * *Protocol changes.* We need to change the protocol to make it suitable for expansions.
 * *Code refactoring.* A lot of code in client is not really nice, because I had strict deadlines when I wrote it. Now it should be repaired.
 * *Spectator mode.*

== KBang 0.3 ==
 * *Dodge City.*
