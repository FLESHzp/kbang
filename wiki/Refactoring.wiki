#summary The plans and progress of code refactoring.

= Introduction =

I have realized that some parts of code need to be refactored. Especially I want to have some common code for both client and server, for example parsing code.



= Stuff to think about =

 * *class diagrams* yeah, I still do not feel OK about them - let's draw 'dem once and for all
 * *project organization* - it's getting too messy to have all the project sources in the one directory. I should reorganize parts of project into packages. Some diagrams should be drawn as well.
 * *threads* Recently I started to doubt if I really need them - they are used for AIs now
